# Wright Fisher Simulator
## About
<a href="https://github.com/TomMakesThings/Wright-Fisher-Simulator/blob/main/WrightFisher.ipynb">This Jupyter notebook</a> contains a simulator for the Wright-Fisher model of genetic drift in which allele frequency is modelled over time for either an asexual haploid population with a single allele, or a diploid population with both sexual and asexual reproduction modelling two alleles in linkage disequilibrium.
