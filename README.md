# Wright Fisher Simulator
## About
<a href="https://github.com/TomMakesThings/Wright-Fisher-Simulator/blob/main/WrightFisher.ipynb">This Jupyter notebook</a> contains a simulator for the classic and modified versions of Wright-Fisher model of genetic drift. The standard Wright-Fisher model simulates a haploid, asexual, panmictic population of size N over t generations for a single loci with two alleles a and A. The modified simulator models a diploid population with both sexual and asexual reproduction featuring two alleles in linkage disequilibrium.
